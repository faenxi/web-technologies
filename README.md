While learning how to work with Git, I learned many new commands and tools and visually and in detail got acquainted with how branches and commits work.
I was surprised how much commands can significantly simplify work in git. 
This knowledge can help me in the future when working in an IT career for teamwork and saving and managing versions of projects.
